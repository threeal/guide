Manage Debian Packages Using APT
================================

`Advanced Package Tool <https://wiki.debian.org/Apt>`_ (APT) is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`_, `Ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com/>`_, and related `Linux <https://www.linux.org/>`_ distributions.
APT simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.
